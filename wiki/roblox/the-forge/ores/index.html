        <h1>Ores</h1>
        <p>Ores are an important in-game resource in The Forge, obtained by mining Rocks. These various items are used to create various types of Weapons and Armors. They take on their own special and unique appearances and their own rarity, which sets them apart from one another. They are obtainable through different caves. Note that different caves and rocks have different ores.</p>
